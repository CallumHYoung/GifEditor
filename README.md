# GifEditor

A tool I built to handle Gif images and change the frame data.

I initially created the tool to handle Gif images that didn't have the clean up bit toggled on and displayed incorrectly in Discord.
This tool enabled me to edit hundreds of images and change the cleanup routine for each frame so that the bot I was writing could use them.
